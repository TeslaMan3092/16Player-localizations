# 16Player Localizations

Thanks for deciding to help localize 16Player into your language.

To start, you will want to get a copy of the enlgish localization [here](https://github.com/TeslaMan3092/16Player-localizations/blob/main/en.lproj/Localizable.strings). Then simply copy the entire file into a text edditor of your choosing. 

The format of the .strings files is simple... the text in UPSRECASE shoukd not be eddited, as it is what 16Player looks at to know where that string should go. The text on the left, of the equal sign in "qoutes", is what you should change. Make sure to keep the qoutes and only chnage whats inside the qoutes.

An exmaple looks like this...
This is the english translation of Lock screen in the `.strings` file
```
LOCK_SCREEN = "Lock Screen";
```
If you were trying to translate this to french it would then look like this
```
LOCK_SCREEN = "Ecran vÃ©rouillÃ©";
```
It is a good idea to follow allong in 16Player's settings as you translate. Another thing to keep in mind is try to use univeral language, try not to make your translation specific to your dialect. 

Once you have completed translating, you contact me in the contact section of 16Player or [join my discord server](https://discord.gg/9MnqevttA4) and send your localzation file.

**Testing**
<br>
An easy way test your localzation is to copy paste the file into the current used langages folder. Dont worry if you mess somthing up just reinstall 16Player from chariz and it will go back to default. The path of the main folder is (your JBs root folder)/Library/Application Support/SixteenPlayerLocalization.bundle/(your current used langage folder)  (this is usally english).
Once you are there open the .strings file and dlete whats there then paste your new localzation. Once you have done all that, make sure to kill the settings app in app switcher then re-open 16Player's settings and you should see 16Player's strings in your language.
